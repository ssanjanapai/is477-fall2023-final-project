MissingOutputException in rule prepare in file /Users/sanjana_pai/Desktop/is477-fall2023-final-project/Snakefile, line 1:
Job 0 completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
snakefolder/prepare_output.txt
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
